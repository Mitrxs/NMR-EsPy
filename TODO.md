# NMR-EsPy TODO

## Features To Add

- [ ] 2DJ Module
- [ ] Filtering by automated spanning of the frequency space.
- [ ] Visualisation of the optimisation as it runs.
- [ ] Investigate different filtering approaches (FIR filters, interpolation/decimation etc).

## Code Improvements

- [ ] `ArgumentChecker`: Specify callables explicitly
- [ ] `ExpInfo`: Take number of points out.
- [ ] `plot.py`: Residual is very far from spectrum in examples in `test_plot.py`. Look into this.
