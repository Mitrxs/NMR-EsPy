Theory Overview
===============

.. note::

   This page is work in progress.

On this page, I provide a brief overview of the goal of NMR-EsPy and how
it attempts to achieve this. If you simply wish to use NMR-EsPy without
worrying about the underlying theory, feel free to skip this.

The signal produced as a result of a typical NMR experiment (FID) can be
thought of as a summation of a number of complex exponentials, in
the presence of experimental noise. For the general case of a signal from a
:math:`D`-dimensional NMR experiment, we expect the functional form of the
signal at any time during acquisition to be:

.. math::
   y(t_1, \dots, t_D) = \sum_{m=1}^{M}
   \left\lbrace a_m \exp\left(\mathrm{i} \phi_m\right)
   \prod_{d=1}^{D} \exp\left[\left(2 \pi \mathrm{i} f_{d,m} -
   \eta_{d,m}\right)t_d\right]\right\rbrace + w(t_1, \dots, t_D),

where

* :math:`t_d` is the time cosidered in the :math:`d`\-th dimension
* :math:`M` is the number of complex exponentials (oscillators) contributing to the FID.
* :math:`a_m` is the amplitude of oscillator :math:`m`
* :math:`\phi_m` is the phase of oscillator :math:`m`
* :math:`f_{d,m}` is the frequency of oscillator :math:`m` in the
  :math:`d`\-th dimension
* :math:`\eta_{d,m}` is the damping factor of oscillator :math:`m` in the
  :math:`d`\-th dimension
* :math:`w(t_1, \dots, t_D)` is the contribution from experimental noise

Of course, NMR signals are digitised, and so the raw output of an experiment
will be a :math:`D`-dimensional array :math:`\boldsymbol{Y}` of a finite
shape:

.. math::
   \boldsymbol{Y} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_1 \times \dots \times N_D},

where :math:`N_d` is the number of points sampled in the :math:`d`\-th
dimension. Assuming that the signal is uniformly sampled in each dimesnion,
the time at which any point is sampled is given by

.. math::
   \tau_{n}^{(d)} = n_d \Delta t_d, \quad n_d \in \{0, 1, \dots, N_d - 1\},

where :math:`\Delta t_d` is the sampling rate (the time between successive
samples) in dimension :math:`d`. The discrete fid :math:`\boldsymbol{Y}`
therefore has elements :math:`Y\left[n_1, \dots, n_D\right]` of the form

.. math::
  Y\left[n_1, \dots, n_D\right] = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \left\lbrace a_m
  \exp\left(\mathrm{i} \phi_m\right) \prod_{d=1}^{D} \exp\left[\left(2 \pi
  \mathrm{i} f_{d,m} - \eta_{d,m}\right) \tau_n^{(d)}\right]\right\rbrace
  + W(n_1, \dots, n_D)

Writing this in a more succinct notation:

.. math::
   \boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{X}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) +
   \boldsymbol{W}

where the vector :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^{(2+2D)M}` cotains
all the deterministic parameters which describe the signal

.. math::
   \boldsymbol{\theta} = \left[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_M, \phi_1, \dots, \phi_M,
   f_{1,1}, \dots, f_{1,M}, \dots, f_{D,1}, \dots, f_{D,M}, \eta_{1,1}, \dots
   \eta_{D,M}\right]^{\mathrm{T}}

The goal of NMR-EsPy is to estimate :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}` for a given
signal. This is rather challenging, especially for signals with many resonances,
as one doesn't even know how many oscilltors are contained within the signal in
general (:math:`M`).

To estimate :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}`, we apply `Newton's Method`, an
iterative procedure which attempts to locate extrema of functions.
In the case of NMR-EsPy, we wish to minimise the following:

.. math::
   \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \lVert \tilde{\boldsymbol{Y}} -
   \boldsymbol{X}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \rVert_2^2

where :math:`\tilde{\boldsymbol{Y}} = \boldsymbol{Y} / \lVert \boldsymbol{Y}
\rVert`. This is a very commonly encountered function in the context of
optimisation, called the
`residual sum of squares <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares>`_.
There are numerous variants of Newton's method, but the general idea
is to approximate the neighbourhood of :math:`\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\theta})`
about the current value of :math:`\boldsymbol{\theta}` as quadratic, and to
determine a step with a certain direction and size such that
:math:`\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\theta})` is reduced. This procedure is iterated
until the routine converges to a minimum in the function.
