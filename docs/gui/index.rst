Using the Graphical User Interface
==================================

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is available for using NMR-EsPy without
the requirement of writing Python scripts. The GUI provides the majority of
functionality that you can achieve with the NMR-EsPy API, though for greater
flexibility, if you are competent at Python, you might prefer to stick to
script writing.

Before an in-depth description of using the GUI, you should note the following
general points:

**Using entry boxes**

In many scenarios you can insert information using an entry box. Most of these
require validation before the input you provide is accepted. Once you enter
text into an entry box, it will be highlighted in red. Once you have entered
the desired value, press ``<Enter>``. Once you do this, the value you have
provided will be checked to ensure it is valid. If it is, the value will be
accepted. Otherwise, the entry box will revert its value back to the previous
value. The red highlight will also disappear.
